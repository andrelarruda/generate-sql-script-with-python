# Reading a CSV file and generating a SQL Script with pandas

## Main goal of the script
This script was created to automate a quite simple task:
Read an specific column of a CSV file and create a SQL script using its data.

At a first look it seems to be easy, but if you have a CSV containing thousands of rows, it could be handful to automate it using Python library pandas.
